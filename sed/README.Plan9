This is the actual source directory for GNU sed. It will be linked to the gnulib library generated in the /lib directory.

Dependencies:
    libutf8:
            I am using GNU libutf8 to provide the wchar.h / wctype.h functions so 
            these are defined as present in config.h and removed from the gnulib.

sed will be installed as /$objtype/bin/gsed
